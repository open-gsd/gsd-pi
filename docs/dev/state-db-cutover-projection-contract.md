# Projection contract — frozen format, read-only projections, de facto public API

> **Status:** Active milestone contract. Recorded 2026-08-02 by the state-DB
> cutover milestone (wave 3, task T019). Companion to
> [`state-db-cutover-milestone-decision.md`](state-db-cutover-milestone-decision.md)
> (the decision record and its accepted residual risks) and
> [`ADR-046-database-authoritative-workflow-lifecycle.md`](ADR-046-database-authoritative-workflow-lifecycle.md).

## 1. The rule: projections are read-only views of DB state

The database (`.gsd/gsd.db`) is the single source of truth for workflow state.
Every markdown file this document inventories is a **projection** of that
database — a rendered view, not a record.

- **Writers MUST go through the DB.** No tool, agent, or human may hand-edit a
  projection to change project state. A projection edit is not a state change;
  it is drift that the next render silently discards. `.gsd/STATE.md` and
  `.gsd/gsd.db` are additionally protected at the tool boundary by
  `src/resources/extensions/gsd/write-intercept.ts`, which blocks direct Write
  and common shell writes to them. The Bash guard allows inspection with
  `sqlite3 -readonly .gsd/gsd.db 'SELECT 1'` (also `--readonly`), copies from
  the state file to another destination, and filename searches such as
  `grep -rn 'gsd.db|STATE.md' src/`. The SQLite exemption requires the flag
  among the leading option flags, before the database path; SQL text alone
  does not grant an exemption. SQLite library access remains blocked.
  `cp`/`mv` detection checks the destination, including a closing quote and
  supported trailing redirections or comments. Source-only `mv` commands
  also pass this check, even though moving the source removes it.
  This is a pattern guard, not a full shell parser: general quoted-argument
  parsing and SQLite options with separate values (such as `-init FILE`)
  remain outside its supported parsing. Regression cases live in
  `src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/block-db-writes.test.ts`.
- **Readers MUST NOT treat projections as authority.** Reading a projection is
  legitimate for display, for external integrations that only need a snapshot,
  and for drift detection (which compares projection against DB *by design*).
  Deriving lifecycle decisions — dispatch eligibility, status, completion —
  from a parsed projection is not.
- **Drift heals by re-render, never by import.** A projection that disagrees
  with the DB is repaired by re-rendering from the DB
  (`renderAllFromDb` in `src/resources/extensions/gsd/markdown-renderer.ts`),
  not by parsing the file back into state.

The discuss-to-plan handoff has a narrow compatibility exception:
`checkAutoStartAfterDiscuss` in `discussion-handoff.ts` registers an on-disk
CONTEXT artifact when the milestone row is available, the depth gate permits
handoff, and the database has no milestone-scoped CONTEXT artifact. Existing
CONTEXT rows are preserved. Registration leaves milestone status unchanged;
state derivation still reads the database. Lookup or registration failures log
a warning without rejecting the handoff. This exception does not register
ROADMAP-only handoffs or import edits over an existing CONTEXT row. See the
out-of-band CONTEXT regression in
`src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/check-auto-start-ready-guard.test.ts`.

## 2. Frozen format inventory

For this milestone the projection format and locations are **FROZEN**: rendered
output stays **byte-compatible with the pre-cutover format and location**, and
the only permitted change is **additive** — the state-version stamp in §3.
Strip the stamp and the pre-cutover byte stream is reproduced exactly.

Projection root: `.gsd/` at the project root (`gsdProjectionRoot()` in
`paths.ts`). In real installs `<project>/.gsd` is a **symlink** into
`~/.gsd/projects/<hash>/` (ADR-002 amendment, ADR-031), so the files below
physically live outside the repository.

### 2.1 Root-level projections (`.gsd/`)

`GSD_ROOT_FILES` in `src/resources/extensions/gsd/paths.ts`:
`STATE.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `QUEUE.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`,
`OVERRIDES.md`, `KNOWLEDGE.md`, `CODEBASE.md`. Legacy all-lowercase filenames
(`state.md`, `project.md`, …) remain recognized on read. `RUNTIME.md` is
resolved alongside them.

`STATE.md` is rendered by `renderStateProjection()` in
`workflow-projections.ts` (derived state → `atomicWriteSync`), **not** by the
`markdown-renderer.ts` write path, and therefore carries **no** stamp (§3.4).

`renderStateProjection()` is the only `STATE.md` writer and
`renderStateContent()` is the only content builder. The contract:

- It is rendered after each DB mutation (host and MCP child), in the full
  rebuild (`projection-worker.ts`), by doctor, on guided entry, and after
  `/gsd migrate` commits its import.
- It is never deleted. When the DB is unavailable the file stays unchanged and
  the render reports `stale`; no placeholder page is written.
- Each changed render records its sha in `.gsd/.compat.json`, so a normal
  render puts nothing in quarantine. An unchanged render does not rewrite the
  marker, and a marker failure does not make the render stale.
- A hand edit is replaced on the next render, and one copy of the edited bytes
  is kept under `.gsd/quarantine/projections/`. The external-edit observer
  skips `STATE.md`, so the file is never moved away.

Regression tests:
`src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/workflow-projections.test.ts`,
`src/resources/extensions/gsd/tests/gsd-rebuild.test.ts` (observer skip), and
`packages/mcp-server/src/state-md-render.test.ts`.

### 2.2 Hierarchy projections — two layouts, both frozen

Layout selection is per project and layout-aware
(`layout-policy.ts`, `paths.ts`); both shapes stay supported and unchanged.

| Artifact | Flat-phase layout (current) | Legacy layout (still read/written where present) |
|---|---|---|
| Milestone ROADMAP | `.gsd/phases/NN-slug/NN-ROADMAP.md` | `.gsd/milestones/MID/MID-ROADMAP.md` |
| Milestone-scoped artifacts (CONTEXT, RESEARCH, VALIDATION, SUMMARY, …) | `.gsd/phases/NN-slug/NN-<TYPE>.md` | `.gsd/milestones/MID/MID-<TYPE>.md` |
| Slice PLAN | `.gsd/phases/NN-slug/NN-MM-PLAN.md` | `.gsd/milestones/MID/slices/SID/SID-PLAN.md` |
| Slice SUMMARY / UAT and other slice-scoped artifacts | `.gsd/phases/NN-slug/NN-MM-<TYPE>.md` | `.gsd/milestones/MID/slices/SID/SID-<TYPE>.md` |
| Task SUMMARY | `.gsd/phases/NN-slug/SID-TID-SUMMARY.md` | `.gsd/milestones/MID/slices/SID/tasks/TID-SUMMARY.md` |

`NN` is the zero-padded phase number derived from the milestone id, `MM` the
zero-padded plan number derived from the slice id (`planFileName`,
`phaseDirName` in `layout-policy.ts`). In flat-phase layout tasks are
checkboxes inside the slice PLAN; only non-PLAN task artifacts get their own
file.

Render entry points (all route through the single `writeAndStore` seam in
`markdown-renderer.ts`): `renderRoadmapFromDb`, `renderPlanFromDb`,
`renderTaskPlanFromDb`, `renderMilestoneArtifactsFromDb`,
`renderMilestoneSummary`, `renderSliceArtifactsFromDb`, `renderSliceSummary`,
`renderTaskSummary`, `renderReplanFromDb`, `renderAssessmentFromDb`, and the
sweep `renderAllFromDb`.

Every task-summary producer routes through `writeTaskSummaryProjection`, which
owns layout-aware placement and delegates stamping, disk persistence, artifact
lineage, compatibility-marker updates, and cache invalidation to
`writeAndStore`. A lineage-write failure is surfaced to the caller; the disk
copy remains a non-authoritative projection for reconciliation evidence.

### 2.3 What the freeze covers

Frozen: file names, directory shapes, both layouts, section ordering, heading
text, checkbox and badge syntax, and the trailing-newline byte stream of every
file above. Any change beyond appending the §3 stamp is out of scope for this
milestone.

## 3. The additive state-version stamp

### 3.1 Exact format

```html
<!-- gsd:state-version=<projectRevision>:<authorityEpoch> -->
```

Both values are decimal integers. The stamp occupies **one line at end of
file**, terminated by a newline, and is the file's last byte sequence.
Canonical regex (`markdown-renderer.ts`):
`/<!-- gsd:state-version=(\d+):(\d+) -->/`.

Values come from the `project_authority` singleton row (`revision`,
`authority_epoch`) — the same row the cutover receipt advances. When the DB or
that row is unavailable, the renderer stamps `0:0`.

### 3.2 Scope

Every projection written through `writeAndStore` in `markdown-renderer.ts` is
stamped. Re-render is **strip-then-stamp**, so replayed artifact content never
accumulates stamp lines: disk bytes, the `artifacts.full_content` row, and the
value returned to callers are identical.

### 3.3 How readers must treat it

**Ignore-safe.** It is an HTML comment: markdown renderers do not display it,
and a reader that does nothing about it sees exactly the pre-cutover content.
External readers are *not* required to parse it.

A reader that wants freshness may parse it (`readProjectionStateVersion`) and
compare `R:E` against the DB's current project revision/authority epoch. A
reader that wants to compare content must strip it first
(`stripProjectionStamp`) — never diff raw bytes across a stamp boundary.

### 3.4 What is not stamped

`STATE.md` (rendered by `workflow-projections.ts`), `DECISIONS.md` (written by
the db-writer), and `.planning/` projections (planning-writer) are outside the
`markdown-renderer.ts` write path and carry no stamp. A reader must therefore
treat "no stamp" as normal, never as evidence of tampering or staleness.

### 3.5 How drift detection uses it

Drift judgments are **stamp-insensitive**: the on-disk bytes are stripped of
the stamp before comparison against the DB render intent
(`markdown-renderer.ts`, `detectProjectionDrift` / the plan- and
roadmap-render-intent checks), so a stamp-only difference is **never** content
drift. The stamp additionally serves as a fast-path freshness signal for the
drift detectors under `state-reconciliation/drift/`: a projection whose `R:E`
equals the DB's current revision/authority epoch is fresh without a content
parse; an unstamped or mismatched projection falls back to the existing content
comparison. Verdicts and reasons are byte-identical for equivalent states
either way.

## 4. This layer is a de facto public API

The projection layer is a **de facto public API**. Tools outside this
repository parse these files, and because `.gsd` is a symlink into
`~/.gsd/projects/<hash>/`, the full reader set is unobservable from the repo —
no repo-side evidence can enumerate it.

Consequences, binding for this milestone:

1. The format is frozen (§2) and changes are additive-only (§3). No renaming,
   no reordering, no relocation.
2. **Any future versioning of this format requires its own milestone** — with
   an explicit compatibility plan, a deprecation window, and a release-note
   directive. It may not ride along inside an unrelated change.
3. The compatibility window that governs legacy import/export and downgrade is
   ADR-046's, verbatim: *"Explicit legacy import/export compatibility remains
   for two stable releases and at least 60 days, whichever is longer, beginning
   when Import Preview and Import Application ship."* This milestone's ruling
   (2026-08-01) restates it as the downgrade window: **2 stable releases + ≥60
   days**. Time alone is not a Removal Gate.

## 5. Known external reader surfaces

Known does not mean complete (§4). These are the surfaces observable from this
repo:

| Surface | What it reads | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `@opengsd/mcp-server` | Raw `.gsd/STATE.md` contents returned to MCP clients; milestone `SUMMARY` **existence** as a completion signal; `.gsd/` artifact parsing (STATE.md, milestone ROADMAPs, slice PLANs) in its graph build | `packages/mcp-server/src/server.ts:278`, `:308`, `:1486` |
| `integrations/hermes` (Python) | Requires `.gsd/` with `STATE.md` present; an absent/empty `STATE.md` is documented as the cause of an empty snapshot | `integrations/hermes/docs/setup.md:35`, `:235`; fixture `integrations/hermes/tests/fixtures/minimal-project/.gsd/STATE.md` |

Because the format is frozen and the stamp is ignore-safe, none of these
readers can break at the moment DB authority flips.
